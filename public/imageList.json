The order the color sets are displayed is randomized, as is the order of the individual color blocks within each set. The target color for each set does <strong>not</strong> change. Getting an answer wrong subtracts 10 seconds from whatever time you have left. The correct answer gives you 1 point. Your final score is the number of correct answers added to the remaining number of seconds.",
